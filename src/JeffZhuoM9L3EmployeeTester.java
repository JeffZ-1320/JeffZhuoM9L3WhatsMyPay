Program description:
    You are the payroll supervisor. Your company pays the employees every two weeks. The formula for overtime pay is the
    same regardless of what job you perform. Once you work 40 hours a week, the overtime formula calculates. This
    formula is the most common problem in your department so you have decided to write a program to calculate each
    employeeâ€™s pay.
What I learned from this program:
    How to read from a file and create objects to perform actions.
What difficulties did I have and how I solved them:
    This assignment took me a while, and the $payRate in the file took some time to figure out and get rid of.
